<p>A cohort is a group of students with shared characteristics that are
tracked for reporting purposes. New, degree seeking students are
assigned a cohort when they enter the University. They are placed in a
cohort based on data in the census enrollment snapshot. There are eight
cohorts students are placed in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, Freshman</li>
<li>Full-time, Bachelors degree seeking, Transfer</li>
<li>Part-time, Bachelors degree seeking, Freshman</li>
<li>Part-time, Bachelors degree seeking, Transfer</li>
<li>Full-time, Associates degree seeking, Freshman</li>
<li>Full-time, Associates degree seeking, Transfer</li>
<li>Part-time, Associates degree seeking, Freshman</li>
<li>Part-time, Associates degree seeking, Transfer</li>
</ul>
<p>The fields used to drive the cohorts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-time part-time code - based on enrolled credits at census</li>
<li>Primary degree id - based on the degree level of the students
declared program at census</li>
<li>Student Type - based the student type at census</li>
</ul>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="cohort-creation">Cohort Creation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cohort-creation"></a>
</h2>
<p>A student is placed in a cohort only once, on the term when they have
a student type of Freshman (F) or Transfer (T); these student types are
undergraduate degree seeking students.</p>
<ul>
<li>Graduate students are not placed in cohorts. Only undergraduate
students are placed in a cohort.</li>
<li>Non-degree seeking students are not placed in cohorts. Only degree
seeking undergraduate students are placed in a cohort.</li>
<li>A student is not ever removed from or taken out of the cohort. A
student could be excluded based on the exclusions flag.
<ul>
<li>Exclusion: Students who died or were totally and permanently
disabled; students who left school to serve in the armed forces (or have
been called up to active duty); those who left to serve with a foreign
aid service of the federal government, such as the Peace Corps; and
those who left to serve on official church missions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a student is readmitted, they do not get placed in a cohort
again, they still have their original cohort.</li>
<li>There are students who never get placed in a cohort.
<ul>
<li>Graduate students are not placed in a cohort. They could have a
cohort if they attended while pursing a undergraduate degree but there
are no cohorts for graduate students, only undergraduate students.</li>
<li>Non-Degree Seeking students are not placed in a cohort.
<ul>
<li>When a student with the student type of High School (H) attends
after they graduate from high school they get a student type of Freshman
(F) or Transfer (T) and would be placed in a cohort at that time.</li>
<li>When a student with a student type of Personal Interest, Non-Degree
(P) moves into a degree seeking program, they do not get placed in a
cohort. They move from a student type of Personal Interest, Non-Degree
(P) to Continuing Registration (C) and because they never have a student
type of Freshman (F) or Transfer (T) they are never placed in a
cohort.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cohorts prior to 2009 are not in Edify. If a student was placed in a
cohort before 2009, they are non-cohorted or null.</li>
<li>There are some students who never get a student type of Freshman (F)
or Transfer (T) because they had an incorrect student type at Census,
these students never get placed in a cohort.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are a few students who had conflicts between their program and
their student type at census. If the student has a student type of F or
T then they are placed in a cohort even if their program shows they are
a high school student.</li>
